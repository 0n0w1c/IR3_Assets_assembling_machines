# IR3 Assets: assembling machines

Reskins the assembling machines to use IR3 graphical assets, if installed.

*Requires the manual installation of the Industrial Revolution 3 Asset Packs*

Due to the licensing restrictions, the IR3 Assets can not be repackaged for Factorio 2.0.  
However, users have full permissions to make the necessary modifications themselves.  

See the mod [IR3 Assets: Some assembly required](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/IR3_Assets_some_assembly_required)

If the IR3 Assets are not installed, this mod will do nothing.

This mod does **not** include IR3 or the assets.
